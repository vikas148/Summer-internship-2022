# programs

1 Reverse an array? Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```
```

2 Explain the properties of the join array method function via program?

```
```

3 Show all the values of an array in a html webpage using DOM and forEach method?
```
```
4 Merge to sets in javascript? (hint use Set class in javascript)
```
