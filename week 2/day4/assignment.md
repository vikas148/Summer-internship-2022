# Theory

***Q1*** **What are the basic data types in TypeScript?**
>>Node.js is a framework for writing server-side JavaScript applications. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it perfect for data-intensive, real-time applications.

***Q2 What is V8 Engine?***
>>V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript code. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs (they all makeup runtime environment) are provided by the browser.

***Q3  What is Event Loop in NodeJS.***
>>The event loop is what allows Node. js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.

***Q4 . What is the use of tsconfig.json file?***
>>The tsconfig. json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. JavaScript projects can use a jsconfig. json file instead, which acts almost the same but has some JavaScript-related compiler flags enabled by default.

***Q5 What are the methods provided by `fs` module to manipulate files?***
>>The fs module allows user to interact with the file system.
The fs module provides a lot of functionality for interacting with the file system. Some of the more common functions are:

- writeFile()
- writeFileSync()
- fs.access()
- fs.appendFile()


***Q6 What is an API***
>>What is an API with example?
Image result for What is API?
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

***Q7 7. What is JSON format?***
>>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. It is "self-describing" and easy to understand. For Example:
```
{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"},
]
}
```

***Q8 Why we use JSON format for API?***
>>REST APIs should accept JSON for request payload and also send responses to JSON. JSON is the standard for transferring data. Almost every networked technology can use it: JavaScript has built-in methods to encode and decode JSON either through the Fetch API or another HTTP client.

***Q9 What is a Framework?***
>>The definition of framework is a support structure or system that holds parts together, has something stretched over it or acts as the main structure. An example of a framework is four posts supporting a deck cover. An example of a framework is an outline created before writing an essay.

***Q10  How an HTTP Communication works***
>> Through the HTTP protocol, resources are exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet. Client devices send requests to servers for the resources needed to load a web page; the servers send responses back to the client to fulfill the requests.


- HTTP utilizes specific request methods in order to perform various tasks. All HTTP servers use the GET and HEAD methods.
- GET requests a specific resource in its entirety
- HEAD requests a specific resource without the body content
- POST adds content, messages, or data to a new page under an existing web resource
- PUT directly modifies an existing web resource or creates a new URI if need be
- DELETE gets rid of a specified resource
- TRACE shows users any changes or additions made to a web resource
- OPTIONS shows users which HTTP methods are available for a specific URL
- CONNECT converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
- PATCH partially modifies a web resource

***Q11  What is Middleware in ExpressJS.***
>>Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc
